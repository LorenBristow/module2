for i in range(2,11,2):
    print(i)
print("Goodbye!")

## There are many ways to solve this problem! Here is one:
#for count in range(11):
#    if count != 0 and count % 2 == 0:   #% modulus checking if even number
#        print(count)
#print("Goodbye!")
#
## Here is another:
#for count in range(2, 12, 2):
#    print(count)
#print("Goodbye!")
